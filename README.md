# Sign Up Form

This project is a simple, yet elegant sign-up form designed with HTML and CSS following my path through The Odin Project curriculum. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to enter their personal information, such as their first name, last name, and email address.

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- [index.html](index.html): This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the sign-up form.
- [style.css](style.css): This CSS file contains all the styles used to make the sign-up form visually appealing.
- [Norse-Bold.otf](Norse-Bold.otf): This is a custom font used to enhance the typography of the sign-up form.
- [README.md](README.md): This file provides an overview of the project.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the [index.html](index.html) file in your web browser. You can then interact with the sign-up form and enter your information.
